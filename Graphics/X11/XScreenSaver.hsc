-- | XScreenSaverSetAttributes sets the attributes to be used the next  time
-- the  external  screen  saver is activated.  If another client currently
-- has the attributes set, a BadAccess error is generated and the  request
-- is ignored.
--
-- Otherwise,  the specified window attributes are checked as if they were
-- used in a core CreateWindow request whose  parent  is  the  root.   The
-- override-redirect field is ignored as it is implicitly set to True.  If
-- the window attributes result in an error according  to  the  rules  for
-- CreateWindow, the request is ignored.
--
-- Otherwise,  the  attributes are stored and will take effect on the next
-- activation that occurs when  the  server  is  not  grabbed  by  another
-- client.   Any  resources  specified for the background-pixmap or cursor
-- attributes may be freed immediately.  The server is free  to  copy  the
-- background-pixmap  or  cursor resources or to use them in place; therefore,
-- the effect of changing the contents of those resources  is  undefined.
-- If  the  specified  colormap  no longer exists when the screen
-- saver activates, the parent's colormap is used instead.  If  no  errors
-- are  generated  by  this  request,  any  previous  screen  saver window
-- attributes set by this client are released.
--
-- When the screen saver next activates and the server is not  grabbed  by
-- another  client,  the screen saver window is created, if necessary, and
-- set to the specified attributes and events are generated as usual.  The
-- colormap   associated  with  the  screen  saver  window  is  installed.
-- Finally, the screen saver window is mapped.
--
-- The window remains mapped and at the top of the  stacking  order  until
-- the  screen  saver is deactivated in response to activity on any of the
-- user input devices, a ForceScreenSaver request with a value  of  Reset,
-- or any request that would cause the window to be unmapped.
--
-- If  the  screen  saver activates while the server is grabbed by another
-- client, the internal saver mechanism  is  used.   The  ForceScreenSaver
-- request  may  be used with a value of Active to deactivate the internal
-- saver and activate the external saver.
--
-- If the screen saver client's connection to the server is  broken  while
-- the  screen saver is activated and the client's close down mode has not
-- been RetainPermanent or RetainTemporary, the current  screen  saver  is
-- deactivated and the internal screen saver is immediately activated.
--
-- When  the  screen saver deactivates, the screen saver window's colormap
-- is uninstalled and the window is unmapped (except as described  below).
-- The  screen  saver  XID is disassociated with the window and the server
-- may, but is not required to, destroy the window along  with  any  children.
--
-- When the screen saver is being deactivated and then immediately reactivated
-- (such as when switching screen savers), the server may leave  the
-- screen saver window mapped (typically to avoid generating exposures).

-- | XScreenSaverSuspend temporarily suspends the screensaver and DPMS timer
-- if suspend is 'True', and restarts the timer if suspend is 'False'.
-- This  function  should  be  used  by  applications  that don't want the
-- screensaver or DPMS to become activated while they're  for  example  in
-- the  process of playing a media sequence, or are otherwise continuously
-- presenting visual information to the user while  in  a  non-interactive
-- state.  This  function  is  not  intended  to  be called by an external
-- screensaver application.
--
-- If XScreenSaverSuspend is called multiple times  with  suspend  set  to
-- 'True',  it must be called an equal number of times with suspend set to
-- 'False' in order for  the  screensaver  timer  to  be  restarted.  This
-- request has no affect if a client tries to resume the screensaver with‐
-- out first having suspended it.  XScreenSaverSuspend  can  thus  not  be
-- used  by one client to resume the screensaver if it's been suspended by
-- another client.
--
-- If a client that has suspended  the  screensaver  becomes  disconnected
-- from  the  X  server,  the  screensaver  timer  will  automatically  be
-- restarted, unless it's still suspended by  another  client.  Suspending
-- the screensaver timer doesn't prevent the screensaver from being forceably
-- activated with the ForceScreenSaver request, or a DPMS  mode  from
-- being set with the DPMSForceLevel request.
--
-- XScreenSaverSuspend  also doesn't deactivate the screensaver or DPMS if
-- either is active at the time the request to suspend them is received by
-- the  X  server. But once they've been deactivated, they won't automatically
-- be activated again, until the client has canceled the suspension.
